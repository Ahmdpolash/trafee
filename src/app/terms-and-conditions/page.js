            Trafee actively monitors traffic, Actions, Bounties and other
            Program-related activities for potential fraud. If Trafee suspects
            that Your account has been used in a fraudulent manner, Your account
            will be deactivated effective immediately and with no notice to You
            pending further investigation. If You add Actions, or inflate
            Actions, through the use of fraudulent means of traffic generation,
            as determined solely by Trafee, You will forfeit all of the Bounties
            related to that Program, and Your Affiliate account will be
            terminated effective immediately. Trafee reserves sole judgment in
            determining fraud and You agree to be bound by any and all such
            determinations. It is the OBLIGATION of Affiliate to prove to Trafee
            that it has NOT engaged in fraud. Trafee will hold Your
            Bounty-related payments in until You have satisfactorily provided
            evidence that demonstrates to Trafee that You have not engaged in
            fraud. If You are unable to provide Trafee with satisfactory
            evidence that You have not engaged in fraud within seven (7) days of
            Your Bounties being placed in “Pending Status,” then Trafee reserves
            the right to terminate Your Affiliate account and cancel payment on
            the applicable Bounties, at its sole discretion and without any
            further obligations to You.
